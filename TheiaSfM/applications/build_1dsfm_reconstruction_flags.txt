############### Incremental SfM Options ###############

# Set this parameter to a value other than NONE if you want to utilize a robust
# cost function during bundle adjustment. This can increase robustness to outliers
# during the optimization.

# Set this parameter to change which camera intrinsics should be
# optimized. Valid options are NONE, ALL, FOCAL_LENGTH, PRINCIPAL_POINTS,
# RADIAL_DISTORTION, ASPECT_RATIO, and SKEW. This parameter can be set using a

############### Track Subsampling Options ###############

# If true, the estimated tracks are subsampled for bundle adjustment to increase
# the efficiency of BA. Tracks are chosen in a way which attempts to constraint
# BA as best as possible. This has been shown to provide a significant speedup
# without reducing the accuracy much (in fact, it increases the accuracy in some
# cases).

# length. We limit the effect of long tracks by capping the track length at this
# value for the purpose of selecting tracks.

# Tracks are chosen in a way that ensures each view is spatially
# constraind. Tracks are first binned in an image grid and the top ranked track
# is chosen for optimization from each grid cell to ensure good spatial coverage
# of the image. The grid cells are set to be this size.
