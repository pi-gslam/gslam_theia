// An implementation of the visibility pyramid used for "next best view" ranking
// as described in: "Structure-from-Motion Revisited" by Johannes Schonberger
// and Jan-Michael Frahm (CVPR 2016). The main idea is that well-constrained
// views have a large number of observations and good spatial distribution of
// those observations. The VisibilityPyramid is used to compute a score for a
// view based on the aforementioned criteria. The view is divided into grid
// cells and a score is assigned to the grid based on the number of occupied
// cells. The score is accumulated over a pyrammid to capture coarse and
// fine-granded distribution statistics.
//
// An online version of this class is available with the COLMAP library, and
// this implementation was slightly inspired by that:
//   https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/master/src/base/visibility_pyramid.h
